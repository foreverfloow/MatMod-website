## About
The assignment will showcase a website for Mathematical Modelling written in HTML and CSS which contains 4 pages: the index page, accessibility, GitHub and activity page. It is required that all pages share one single CSS file and that the folders are structured accordingly. The website should be scalable, meaning that it will work on a narrow screen (portrait), regular wide (16:9) and
ultra-wide screen (21:9) â€” representing a mobile phone, a laptop and a desktop. It is also important to maintain consistent universal accessibility and follow HTML5 and CSS3 guidelines. Our goal is to create a website that is easy for any developer to further improve by building on existing features.
